Is your code ready for publication? A practical introduction to R
Markdown
================

In this workshop participants will learn how to use R Markdown and knitr
to produce literate documents, i.e., documents that combine both
narrative text and code. We will focus on learning best practices to
ensure our analyses are shareable, efficient, and reproducible. Though
the focus will be on scientific articles, we will also learn about how R
Markdown can be used to generate static and dynamic output formats
including HTML, PDF, MS Word, Beamer, HTML5 slides, Tufte-style
handouts, books, dashboards, shiny applications, and websites. No prior
experience is needed. Participants should have a working version of
[R](https://cran.r-project.org) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed.
